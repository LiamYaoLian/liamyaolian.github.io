    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style='text-align:left;position:fixed;top:20vh;left:35%;font-size:2.5vmin;'>
      My experience covers business intelligence, data science, and web<br>
      development. Currently working in a startup, I help clients find hidden<br>
      patterns in data that are tranformed into actionable bussiness insights<br>
      through data analytics and machine learning. I will also involed in web<br> 
      application development.<br><br>


      Before I transitioned to technology, I worked in various fields, including <br>
      investment banking, private equity, venture capital, management <br>
      consulting, and public accounting.<br><br>

      When I conducted due diligence on deals in the technology sector, I <br>
      began reflecting on the trends in the world, the nature of competition, <br>
      and the meaning of life. My life purpose is to solve meaningful  <br>
      problems through data, programming, and strategic thinking that I <br>
      learned in the financial industry and management consulting. <br><br>

      An outstanding data scientist or developer should be a great problem<br>
      solver. Ask the right questions to meet the hidden needs. Do the right<br>
      things to be trustworthy. <br>
